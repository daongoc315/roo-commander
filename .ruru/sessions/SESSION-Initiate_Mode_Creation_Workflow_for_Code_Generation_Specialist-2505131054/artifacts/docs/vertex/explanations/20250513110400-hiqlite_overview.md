Hiqlite is a library that enhances SQLite by providing high availability and an embedded, Raft-based distributed consensus. It also includes caching capabilities.

**Purpose:**

The primary purpose of Hiqlite is to offer a resilient and fault-tolerant data storage solution by layering high-availability features on top of the widely-used SQLite database engine. This makes it suitable for applications that require data persistence and availability even in the event of node failures.

**Key Features:**

Based on the information from its GitHub repository (https://github.com/sebadob/hiqlite) and related mentions:

*   **High Availability:** Hiqlite is designed to ensure that the database remains operational even if some nodes in the cluster go down. This is a core aspect of its functionality.
*   **Embeddable:** Like SQLite, Hiqlite can be embedded directly within an application, simplifying deployment and management.
*   **Raft-Based Consensus:** It utilizes the Raft consensus algorithm to manage data replication and leader election among the nodes in the cluster. This ensures data consistency across the distributed deployment.
*   **SQLite Integration:** Hiqlite builds upon SQLite, meaning users can leverage the familiar SQL interface and features of SQLite while gaining the benefits of high availability.
*   **Caching:** The library incorporates caching mechanisms, which can help improve read performance by storing frequently accessed data in memory.
