Based on the information from the official Hiqlite GitHub repository and general Rust best practices, here's a guide to using Hiqlite in Rust projects, focusing on performance, error handling, and integration with common Rust patterns.

### Performance

Hiqlite is designed with performance in mind, aiming to provide fast local reads by embedding SQLite while ensuring high availability through Raft-based replication.

*   **Leverage Local Reads:** Hiqlite's core strength is fast local data access, avoiding network latency for reads. Design your application to maximize these local read operations.
*   **Async Wrapper:** Hiqlite builds on `rusqlite` and provides an async wrapper. Utilize Rust's async capabilities to handle concurrent operations efficiently.
*   **Batching Writes:** While the documentation mentions achieving up to 24.5k single inserts/s in benchmarks, batching write operations can often further improve throughput by reducing the overhead per transaction.
*   **Understanding `last_applied_log_id` Persistence:** Hiqlite optimizes I/O by not writing the `last_applied_log_id` from Raft messages into SQLite with every write. This reduces I/O significantly. This ID is persisted in memory and written to the database during snapshot creation or backups. Be aware of this mechanism, especially in scenarios involving ungraceful shutdowns, though Hiqlite has an auto-heal feature for such cases.
*   **SQLite Configuration:** The documentation notes that "When configured correctly, SQLite offers very good performance". While Hiqlite handles much of the interaction, ensure your underlying SQLite setup (if configurable through Hiqlite or `rusqlite`) is optimized for your workload (e.g., PRAGMA settings for WAL mode, synchronous, etc., if applicable and exposed).

### Error Handling

The Hiqlite documentation itself does not extensively detail specific error handling patterns for the library. However, standard Rust error handling practices are applicable.

*   **`Result<T, E>`:** Expect Hiqlite functions that can fail to return `Result<T, E>`. Your code should handle these results appropriately, typically using `match` expressions or the `?` operator to propagate errors.
*   **Specific Error Types:** Investigate the specific error types exposed by Hiqlite (and its dependencies like `rusqlite` and `openraft`). Understanding these types will allow for more granular error handling. For example, distinguishing between network errors, database errors, or Raft consensus errors.
*   **`thiserror` and `anyhow`:**
    *   For library-like parts of your application that use Hiqlite, consider using the `thiserror` crate to define custom, specific error types. This allows callers to match on and handle different error conditions programmatically.
    *   For application-level code, the `anyhow` crate can simplify error handling by providing a general `anyhow::Error` type, making it easier to propagate errors without needing to define numerous custom error types. It's often used at the boundaries of your application or for rapid prototyping.
*   **Logging:** Integrate a logging framework (like `tracing` or `log`) to record errors and important events. This is crucial for debugging and monitoring a distributed system like one using Hiqlite.
*   **Panics:** Avoid panicking for recoverable errors. Panics should generally be reserved for unrecoverable states that indicate a bug in the program.

### Integration with Common Rust Patterns

*   **Async/Await:** Hiqlite provides an async wrapper. Embrace Rust's `async/await` syntax for non-blocking operations, especially for network calls inherent in Raft and database interactions. Use an async runtime like Tokio, which Hiqlite lists as a dependency.
*   **Ownership and Borrowing:** Adhere strictly to Rust's ownership and borrowing rules to ensure memory safety and prevent data races, which is especially important in a concurrent, distributed system.
*   **Builder Pattern:** If Hiqlite's API involves complex object creation for configuration or requests, it might use or benefit from the builder pattern. This pattern allows for more readable and maintainable object construction.
*   **Traits for Abstraction:** If you need to abstract Hiqlite's functionality (e.g., for testing or to support different storage backends in the future), define traits that encapsulate the required database operations. Your application logic can then depend on these traits rather than concrete Hiqlite types.
*   **Configuration Management:** Manage Hiqlite connection strings, Raft peer addresses, and other configurations using a standard Rust configuration library (e.g., `config`, `figment`) or environment variables.
*   **Dependency Management with Cargo:** Utilize Cargo, Rust's package manager, to manage Hiqlite and its dependencies. Keep dependencies up to date to benefit from the latest features, bug fixes, and security patches.
*   **Testing:**
    *   **Unit Tests:** Write unit tests for components that interact with Hiqlite, potentially using mock implementations of your data access traits.
    *   **Integration Tests:** Set up integration tests that run against a real (though perhaps in-memory or temporary) Hiqlite cluster to ensure components work together correctly.
*   **Idiomatic Rust:**
    *   Use `clippy` to enforce idiomatic Rust and catch common mistakes.
    *   Format your code with `rustfmt`.
    *   Leverage Rust's powerful type system to make invalid states unrepresentable.
    *   Use iterators and closures where they make sense for concise and expressive code.
