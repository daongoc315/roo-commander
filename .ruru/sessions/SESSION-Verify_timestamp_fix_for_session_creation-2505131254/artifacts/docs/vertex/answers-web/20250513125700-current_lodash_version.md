### Historical Context

## Sources and Limitations

*   **Sources:**
    1.  [Source 1] npm, Inc. - `lodash` package page on npmjs.com. (Considered highly reliable for npm package information).
    2.  [Source 2] Node Package Manager - `lodash` - This appears to be another interface or mirror for npm package information, also listing 4.17.21. (Considered reliable).
    3.  [Source 3] Snyk Advisor - `lodash` package health and security. (Considered a reliable source for package information and security).
    4.  [Source 4] Socket - `lodash` npm package. (Considered a reliable source for package information).
    5.  [Source 5] Stack Overflow - "How to check lodash version?" (Useful for historical context and methods to check versions, but not for the *current* version itself as the accepted answer is from 2015).
*   **Limitations:**
    *   The information is based on the search results available as of the current date. While the npm registry is generally up-to-date, there's always a possibility of a very recent release not yet fully propagated or indexed by all third-party information sites. However, given that version 4.17.21 was published several years ago, this is unlikely to be an issue for `lodash` at this moment.
    *   The search results did not provide specific release notes or a detailed changelog for version 4.17.21 directly, though this information is typically available on the project's GitHub repository or official website.
